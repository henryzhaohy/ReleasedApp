<h2>How to treat low blood sugar?</h2>
<p>
If you are experiencing the signs of a low blood glucose (sugar) level, check your blood glucose (sugar) immediately. If you don&rsquo;t have your meter with you, treat the symptoms anyway. It is better to be safe.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step one: Low blood glucose (sugar) can happen quickly, so it is important to treat it right away.</strong> If your blood glucose (sugar) drops very low, you may need help from another person.</p>
<p>
Eat or drink a fast-acting carbohydrate (15 grams):</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        15 grams of glucose in the form of glucose tablets (preferred choice)</li>
    <li>
        15 millilitres (one tablespoon) or three packets of table sugar dissolved in water</li>
    <li>
        175 millilitres (&frac34; cup) of juice or regular soft drink</li>
    <li>
        Six LifeSavers&reg; (one = 2.5 grams of carbohydrate)</li>
    <li>
        15 millilitres (one tablespoon) of honey (do not use for children less than one year old)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Step two: After treating the symptoms, wait 10 to 15 minutes, then check your blood glucose (sugar) again.</strong> If it is still low:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Treat again</li>
    <li>
        If your next meal is more than one hour away, or you are going to be active, eat a snack, such as half of a sandwich or cheese and crackers (something with 15 grams of carbohydrate and a protein source)</li>
    <li>
        Think about why your blood glucose (sugar) went low and make the necessary changes to avoid low blood glucose again</li>
    <li>
        Wait 45 to 60 minutes before driving</li>
</ul>
