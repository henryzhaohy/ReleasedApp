        <h2><a name="high-blood-sugar"></a>What are high blood sugar levels?</h2>
        <p>High blood sugar and diabetes is caused by a number of abnormalities in the body, one of them being the affected vascular walls of small and large arteries (diabetic micro-and macro-angiopathy) in a process called atherosclerosis.</p>
        <p>We can say that a <b>blood sugar level is high</b> if we measure glucose level and get the following values &#8211; more than 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) on an empty stomach or at any time more than 200mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l).</p>
        <p>High blood sugar levels affect the arteries throughout the body, especially the organs which have the richest blood circulation: heart, brain, kidney, senses, nerves and other organs.</p>
        <p>If the high blood sugar is associated with disturbances in lipid metabolism (blood fat), the abnormalities are more intense. Diabetes is among the risk factors for major non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular (coronary) disease, cerebral vascular disease and peripheral vascular diseases.</p>
