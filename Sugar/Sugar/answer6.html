<h2>
    What happens in diabetes?</h2>
<h3>
    Type 1 diabetes</h3>
<p>
The pancreas is no longer able to make insulin. As a result, people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will need to start on insulin immediately and take it for life. Insulin is given either with multiple daily injections using insulin pens or syringes or by using an insulin pump.</p>
<h3>
    Type 2 diabetes</h3>
<p>
The pancreas no longer produces enough insulin or the body is not able to use its own insulin effectively. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to keep your blood glucose (sugar) levels in your target range through healthy eating, physical activity, and by taking diabetes medication. Ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetes educator (nurse, dietitian, or pharmacist) who can help you with lifestyle changes and managing your blood glucose (sugar) levels. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and, over time, many people will need to use insulin to manage their blood glucose (sugar).</p>
