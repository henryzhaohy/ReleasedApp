<p>
A blood glucose (sugar) meter is used to check your blood glucose (sugar) at home. You can get these meters at most pharmacies or from your diabetes educator. Talk with your diabetes educator or pharmacist about which one is right for you. Once you receive a meter, ensure you receive the proper training before you begin to use it.</p>
<p>
Ask your health-care provider about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How and where to draw blood</li>
    <li>
        How to use and dispose of lancets (the device that punctures your skin)</li>
    <li>
        The size of the drop of blood needed</li>
    <li>
        The type of blood glucose (sugar) strips to use</li>
    <li>
        How to clean the meter</li>
    <li>
        How to check if the meter is accurate</li>
    <li>
        How to code your meter (if needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: Your province or territory may subsidize the cost of blood glucose (sugar) monitoring supplies. <a href="/contact/regional-offices">Contact your local Canadian Diabetes Association branch</a> to find out if this applies to you.</p>
