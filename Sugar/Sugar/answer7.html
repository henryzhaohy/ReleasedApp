<h2><a name="is-diabetes-curable"></a>Can diabetes be cured?</h2>
<p>At this time <b>there is no known official case of cured diabetes</b>. </p>
<p>The fact is that with Diabetes type 1 body&#8217;s cells that produce insulin are destroyed. These cells cannot be regrown or replaced. You need to use insulin injections to control your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>With type 2 diabetes your body does not use insulin properly (also known as insulin resistance). Over the time a patient&#8217;s condition worsens as body cannot make enough insulin to keep blood glucose at normal levels.</p>
<p>With exercise and proper diet you can control your diabetes and live a normal life. Read more about diabetic diet.</p>
